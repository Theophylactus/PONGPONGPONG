# PONG_3D
This is a 3D physics "engine" featuring elastic collisions and some other fancy yet scarce things.
The code might be a bit quirky since no tutorials or guides were followed at any point.
## Dependencies
* libsdl2
* libsdl_ttf

## Some examples

### An even more recent screenshot (after replacing SDL_RenderDrawPoint with the much faster... uhm.. directly putting pixels on the SDL_Surface of the window!)

This project was entirely made as a humble attempt to recreate the glorious 3D graphics we see in PONPONPON:

Now that I have [at least partially] achieved my goal, I shall return home in peace with Zeus's highest blessing.

Thank you.
