# PONG_3D
This is a 3D physics "engine" featuring elastic collisions and some other fancy yet scarce things.
The code might be a bit quirky since no tutorials or guides were followed at any point.
## Dependencies
* libsdl2
* Not a single matrix
* ~libsdl_ttf~
* libsdl_image
* Many sweet, industrially produced chocolate biscuits

## Some examples

### An even more recent screenshot (after replacing SDL_RenderDrawPoint with the much faster... uhm.. directly putting pixels on the SDL_Surface of the window!)

### 11/02/2023, triangles are now flawlessly rendered

This project was entirely made as a humble attempt to recreate the glorious 3D graphics we see in PONPONPON:

メリーゴーランド のりたいの！

Now that I have [at least partially] achieved my goal, I shall return home in peace under Zeus's highest blessing.

~~The triangle drawing function is a bit broken. And so might be the elastic collision.~~ 11/02/2023 FIXED IT!
The elastic collisions might be a bit broken, although I am not entirely sure of that. I might have typed some angles wrong. I hope everyone will be able to forgive me. For anyone wondering, these formulas were not copied (I couldn't find them anywhere!), but derived. For reference, the derivantion for 2D collisions is https://williamecraver.wixsite.com/elastic-equations. Thank you.
